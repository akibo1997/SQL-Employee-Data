# Salary Analysis
Here you will find a Jupyter notebook file of an analysis of the data on salaries. I was able to do a query of the data that included the title, employee, and salary for each row. By importing this data with Pandas, I was able to group the data by title and create a bar chart to compare salaries by title. There is also a histogram of the data that looks at the frequency of each salary. 


## Conclusions
You will see that despite the title, most salaries are relatively the same, meaning that this data may not be realistic for a true company. The distribution of the salaries is mostly around 40,000 per person, demonstrating why each position was paid relatively the same.
